3. Overall, June had the higher temperatures, but December was not that far behind with the average and maximum temperatures. However, the minimum temperatures varied by almost 10 degrees having the largest variance. With a minimum temperature of 56, it can be said that those are not the best temperatures for either surfing or ice cream. 

## Summary 
Oevrall the weather in June and December have been historically very similar, although December has a wider range of results, it does make a case that a yearlong surf and ice cream shop could work with the temperatures provided. 

An additional, query that could be done to gather more information, is to add the recepitation analysis with the temperature analysis. Possibly even look into extreme weather patterns like snow. Lastly, we could look to see the sunny versus cloudy days to help paint the full picture of the weather in Oahu. This will help provide context as to if a day is warm but still had thunderstorms, or it was warm and sunny. Lastly, we could narrow our search for stations to get the weather that is closest to our potential shop.
